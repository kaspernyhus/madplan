This project is foremost a way for me to remember recipies I like to cook. Further more the webpage can create shoppinglists in a todo format for easy shopping. Other features include an 'empty the fridge' functionality as well as a way to plan the dishes for eg.a a week and do all the shopping needed at once.

## Framework
The webapp is written using the web framework [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) with Python. The database used is SQlite3.
